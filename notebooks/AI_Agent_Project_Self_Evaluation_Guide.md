## **Stage 3: Depth and Uniqueness Analysis**
Answer the following to evaluate the depth and originality of your project:

### **Technical Depth**
- Did I use advanced AI agent techniques?
- Did I include theoretical or mathematical analysis?
- Did I perform comparative research between approaches?

### **Originality and Innovation**
- Does the project include original or innovative ideas?
- Did I solve a complex or challenging problem?
- Did I add value beyond the basic requirements?

### **Prompt Engineering Documentation**
- Did I document the development process using AI?
- Did I include examples of significant prompts?
- Did I include best practices learned from experience?

### **Cost and Optimization**
- Did I calculate token usage or API cost?
- Did I present a detailed cost table?
- Did I propose optimization strategies?

## **Stage 4: Self-Scoring Guide (Performance Levels)**

### **Level 1: Score 60–69 (Basic Pass)**
**Description:** Meets minimum submission requirements.

**Characteristics:**
- Functional code that completes the required tasks.
- Basic documentation (README with setup and usage).
- Reasonable but imperfect structure.
- Limited or partial test coverage.
- Results exist but without deep analysis.

**Evaluation style:** Flexible and forgiving, focused on reasoning and effort.

**Recommendation:** Choose this level if the project works but is incomplete or rushed.

---
