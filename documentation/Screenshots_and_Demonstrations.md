# 🖼️ Screenshots and Demonstrations

## 🎯 Document Purpose
This document presents screenshots and demonstrations of the chat system built as part of the project.
The goal is to illustrate the system's functioning in real-time — from starting the servers to routine use of the graphical interface.
The images accompany the main stages of work according to specifications and architecture described in other documents.

## 🧭 Stage 1 – Opening Screen and Settings

When opening the application, the user is presented with an opening screen including model selection, server connection health check, and API key entry.

> The screenshot shows input fields, "Check API" button.

---

## 💬 Stage 2 – Conversation with Bot

Demonstration of chat interface in action – user sends message, system returns response, and shows response time indication and "copy" button.

> The screenshot shows consistent and clear design between user messages and system responses.

## ⚙️ Stage 3 – Model Management and API Connection

Screenshot demonstrating changing active model through interface (for example moving from Phi to Mistral), and connection health check result to Ollama using API Health Check.

## 🧪 Stage 4 – Tests and Error Messages

### ⚠️ Server or Model Problems
Screenshots showing cases where Ollama server is not active or desired model is not installed.

> Screenshots show warning messages when server is not active or model is not installed.

### 🔑 API Key or Address Problems
Illustration for situations where API key is missing, wrong, or server address is incorrect.

📸 [error_api_url_wrong.png](screenshot_images/error_api_url_wrong.png)

> Screenshots show error messages in interface (for example: "API key invalid" or "Model not found").

### 💭 Empty Response Problems
Scenario where request succeeds but model returns empty response.

## 🧰 Stage 5 – Logs and Console Display

This section shows screenshots from development environment (terminal) demonstrating server and UI execution.

### 🚀 Running Ollama Server

## 🧾 Summary

The document presents main scenarios for system activation and illustrates its stability and communication process between Frontend (Streamlit), Backend (FastAPI) and language model (Ollama).
The images reflect main stages in work, and demonstrate design principles — simplicity, clarity, and future extensibility possibility.
